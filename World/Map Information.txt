P = Player Spawn, Max: 1
S = Shop, Max: 2
E = Encounter, Max: 15
C = Chest, Max: 5

The player can walk over any of these Locations, but are blocked by walls (#)

If the player walks over the location, the location is removed IF it is a Chest, Monster or Encounter
Shops and Teleports are not removed, as Shops are re-usable and Teleports are one-time use

In order to keep the location of shops, when the player walks over a shop, it moves to a random location on the map
